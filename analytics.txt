In this assignment, the data visualization graph we used are bar charts and line plots.
 Bar charts represent the humidity and line plots represent the temperature of each day.
 Bar graphs, also known as column charts, use vertical or horizontal bars to represent data
 along both an x-axis and a y-axis visually. Each bar represents one value. When the bars
 are stacked next to one another, the viewer can compare the different bars, or values,
 at a glance. A line graph is commonly used to display change over time as a series of
 data points connected by straight line segments on two axes. The line graph therefore 
helps to determine the relationship between two sets of values, with one data set always
 being dependent on the other set. Line graphs are useful in that they show data variables
 and trends very clearly and can help to make predictions about the results of data not yet
 recorded. Among numerous data visualisation libraries, we chose MATPLOTLIB as our data 
visualisation libraries, the reason why we chose is because the data we are presenting is
 more towards a simple and a set of small data which MATPLOTLIB fulfil this requirement and
 the code are more simple than the other.
